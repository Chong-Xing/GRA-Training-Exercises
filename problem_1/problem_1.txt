In the subfolder problem_1/launch, there is a SAS file

"launch-csits.sas".

It imports some SPSS files that are in the same folder.

The part I want you to concentrate on is in lines 1-75,  
where the files are imported and some recoding is done. 
The code creates several average variables, phys, soc,
sym, ... keli_s.

We have a snapshot of the data, including those recodes,
in a file called 

problem_1/workingdata/data_06-10.csv

We need to have same things in our
new data set, along with all the rest of the information
there.

We are not exactly sure how that file was saved, there
is no mention of it in the SAS file. Hence, we are
suspicious of it.

Write an R program that achieves same purpose, 
compare your imported totals for the variables
with the totals previously obtained.

I've been through this exercise and it took me about
90 minutes to import the data, and I've not yet
resolved some differences between the results I get 
and the numbers in data_06-10.csv. Hence, I'm very
interested to find out what you get.

There are bonus points if your R program is brief and clever. 
But only if it is correct.
