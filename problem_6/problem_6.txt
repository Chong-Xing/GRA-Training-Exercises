The aim of this exercise is to practice loading in multiple data sets,
merging them, and incorporarting additional data provided in other
spreadsheets.

The data here is a subset of data from a linguistics experiment where
non-native French speakers had to decide as quickly as possible if a
word on the computer screen was a real word in French.

Addionally, there is participant-level data (L2ParticipantData.csv)
showing how proficient a particular participant is in French, and
item-level data (StimuluiProperties.csv) providing frequency data for
each word in the experiment.

## Part 1

Write a script that loads in participant data (p101-p105) and merges
them into 1 dataframe. Remove items in the Nonce condition.

## Part 2

Working in the same dataframe from part 1, create new cols "cloze"
"age" "frequency". Import the participant-level cloze and age data,
and the item-level frequecny data.


The final dataframe should look like "merged-data.csv" in the output
folder.
