problem 5

The aim of this exercise is to practice working with date formats and
plotting according to dates.

In the data folder there is a subset of data from the Global Terrorism
Database, with information for years 1999-2015.  The original dataset
is much larger, but a few years and variables are included in this
example dataset.



# part 1

Create a scatter plot that shows the sum total number of global deaths
('nkill') for each month, for each year included in the dataset.  See
kc-plot1.pdf for desired output. Save your plot as a pdf in the output
folder


# part 2

Create a scatter plot of sum total deaths by month/year for just years
2014-2015, and have the x-axis include the month-year information.
See kc-plot2 for desired output. Save your plot as a pdf in the output
folder.
