A client wrote with the following problem.

"We have 2 survey files, pre and post, and we want to combine them
into a single file that has the participant ID's as row values.  We
don't know how to put the PRE and POST files together so they will
come out right.

The files are named:
OnlineRM_POST.csv 
OnlineRM_PRE.csv 

In order to help you understand what we want, we have created a
hand-written CSV file that shows where we want to go.  Can you please
help?"

I copied the data files in the data directory, and put the example
"solution"

IntendedResult.csv

in the client_supplied folder.

I was not sure if I should keep spare copies of all of the files he
sent in the client_supplied folder.  I guess I would say yes, and then
I'l use symbolic links from there into the data directory.  I did not
do that in this case because MS Windows does not have symbolic links
and I did not want to make it inconvenient for Windows users.

My solution to this one required about 20 minutes, although I had an
advantage because a client from School of Education asked exactly the
same thing about 2 months ago.  The solution is in the details of the
merge function in R.  That's a pretty big hint, I think.

My first solution was not entirely perfect because I did not give back
the columns in the order the client wanted in their Intended output.
I tested some fancy ways to make that go, but was not too happy.  I
ended up just copying column names from the intended result file.
That's a little "basic" for my taste, but the fancy ways I see are all
too complicated. But I'll put one in my answers, just so you can see.
