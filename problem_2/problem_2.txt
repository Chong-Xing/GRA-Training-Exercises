There are several items to work with here.

1. Review the file in problem_2/R/scatter.R.

Note that it has several copy/pasted stanzas at the
end where various variables are plotted.

Write a function that gets the same job done.

2. After succeeding in part 1, insert code that
saves the graph results into one pdf file.

3. Oops, your boss said he wanted those graphs
in separate pdf files. Revise to get that done.

4. Consider the graph in problem_2/R/output/scatter-1-103.pdf.
Revise your function to produce a graph like that.

If you aren't keeping your revisions of scatter.R file in git,
you will be unhappy when you want to compare versions.
So I suggest you work on this in Git.
